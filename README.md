# From Dockerfile to Distroless - Container Lab

In this Lab, we'll start with a very basic app, create a container, and improve it iteratively.

During this Lab, you will complete the following tasks:

Inspect an app and apply twelve-factor principles
Building a simple container
Switch to a distroless image
Run as a non-root user
Sign and validate signatures
While doing this, we will take a closer look at code-style and performance of the container build process.
